/*
 * heap.h
 *
 *  This is a Minheap implementation which stores integer numbers.
 *  A minheap is a complete binary tree in which its internal nodes and
 * satisfying that every internal node in the graph stores a key
 * greater than or equal to its parentâ€™s key.
 * 
 * This is the header file with the definitions for the operations for this ADT.
 *
 * Version 1.1 : 
 * 	->Made class template to contain any data type.
 * Version 1.2 :
 * 		->No swaps needed since we can compare the elements before to find the right place in the heap.
 * 		->Constructor of a heap with n elements from an array (no heap) in O(n)
 * 
 * Note that, in order to use compound data types (struct or class) for this template
 * class, you must overload the following operators:
 * 		=			Used to assign values into the heap and to swap or move values inside the heap.
 * 		>			Used to compare which element has got a key greater than the other.
 * 		==			Used to compare two heaps or for looking for an element		
 *
